										<h2>Algorithmic News</h2>
										<p>We are in the era of news algorithms. Computer science has evolved to a stage where algorithms can contribute to news production. 
											News organizations, such as Associated Press, Forbes, Reuters, have been using automation to facilitate the writing of market reports 
											on a daily basis. Algorithms and automation will continue to be incorporated into news 
											production to enhance the scale, speed, efficiency, and breadth of content. 
											With technology advancing, journalists should know how algorithms can better serve 
											journalism. Students will study two major ideas in this class: 1) the new journalism 
											model, where each step of the process is automated and augmented by AI, 2) the application 
											of AI tools in news gathering, producing and distribution. No programming or computer 
											science knowledge is required for this course.</p>

										<h2>Data Journalism</h2>
										<p>Obtaining, interpreting, visualizing, and displaying data have become essential skills for 
											journalists. Fundamentals of Data-Driven Journalism is designed for people who want to acquire 
											knowledge and skills in data journalism and social media data concepts and practices. It provides
											essential techniques and skills on how to effectively work with data and produce accurate and 
											interesting data stories. You will learn the strategies of advanced search, web scraping, 
											data cleaning, data sorting and preparing, data visualization tools, and the practices and 
											principles of transforming data into stories. No programming or statistics knowledge is required 
											for this course.</p>

										<h2>Interactive News</h2>
										<p>The relationship between journalists and their audiences has become a more interactive 
											nature of relationship. Journalists no longer arbitrarily decide the reporting content to 
											inform the audiences. Instead, journalists should develop a thorough grasp of the 
											audiences’ desires, expectations and interests, and try to meet the audiences’ demands in 
											a variety of forms and times. This course focuses on increasing the social media literacies 
											while improving the understanding in what ways professional communicators can reach out to 
											and engage the public in the process of news reporting. This course combines professional 
											skills with theoretical thinking. You will both develop a critical thinking of the role of 
											journalists and audiences in the ever-changing media landscape, and learn the strategies 
											and skills of how to engage and interact with audiences. </p>

											<h2>Digital Journalism</h2>
										  <p>Communication advancements have revolutionized the field of journalism. The new world of 
											journalism is dominated by new software and devices. Although how to write a good story is 
											still at the heart of good journalism, how to use technology skills to conduct interviews 
											and produce stories has become the foundation of a good story. This is a survey course that 
											will introduce you to a suite of techniques, applications and ideas that are employed in 
											contemporary digital media reporting, editing, design and delivery. A major focus of this 
											course will be on the concept of skill development in a digital news environment. You will 
											develop a skill set of information searching and verification, A/V editing, data analysis, 
											and information visualization. </p>

											<h2>Multimedia Capstone</h2>
										  <p>Create an in-depth, enterprise multimedia story, worthy of your professional portfolio.  
												The story must contain at least three different pieces of media, as well as statistics. 
												You'll produce pieces of the multimedia story throughout the semester and submit them for 
												comments and review from the teacher and your fellow students. Revisions for each part of 
												the multimedia story will be expected so that you'll end up with a polished, professional 
												piece of journalism. Students will maintain a website to curate their work, learning how 
												to use what they build in one of the most common content management systems. Students 
												will rely on open-source tools, but will also learn basic coding to customize those tools 
												for more effective digital presentation. Students will also learn about and critique 
												other digital storytelling formats, user experience concepts and web analytics.
