										<h3> <b>Peng, Z.</b>, & Miller, S. (2021). An Examination of How Social and 
											Technological Perceptions Predict Social Media News Use on WeChat. Journalism 
											Practice, 1-20.</h3>
											
											<p> The decision to use a particular social media application for news is
												affected by many factors, but less is understood is how a platform’s
												technological features promote or impede people’s social media
												news use. A structural equation model derived from the Unified
												Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology and Task-Technology
												Fit models were applied to investigate what social and
												technological perceptional factors explain people’s news use
												behaviors within the context of WeChat. Results showed an
												application’s technological features (i.e., technology characteristics
												and task-technology fit) played a significant role in predicting
												multiple social media news use behaviors. We put forth a
												theoretical model that predicts social media news use based on
												the results.</p>

												78-96.</h3>
												
												<p> Teachers shape how aspiring journalists collect and evaluate information.
													 The primary method journalists employ to gather this information is 
													 through the interviewing method. However, research has yet to be conducted
													 on how this important competency is taught in university settings. This study sought to identify the
													instructional approaches used by print and broadcast journalism educators through
													qualitative interviews. The results revealed that a variety of exercises and pedagogical approaches (i.e., observation, simulation, direct experience, and reinforcement) are employed by educators to teach students the complexities of the
													interviewing process. We also highlighted classroom exercises, identified challenges,
													and shared teaching strategies concerning the teaching of both broadcast and print
													journalistic interviewing.</p>

												<p> Which bystanders will confront racist, misogynist, personal attacks in news comment
													sections? This article applies sociological concepts of deviance and social control to
													categorize efforts to moderate online news comments. Three dimensions of social
													control are theorized: affirming and sanctioning social control, formal and informal
													social control, and direct and indirect social control. Particular focus is on indirect
													informal social control (i.e. rating and reporting of news comments) in order to
													examine which users are likely to intervene to maintain social order. An analysis of
													secondary data from a survey of online news users found that demographics play an
													important role—younger, wealthier, White, males are most likely to report abusive
													comments. Trust in the news media and authoritarian personality traits also significantly
													predicted bystander intervention. Theoretical implications for the role of social control
													in enforcing social norms in news comment spaces and for professional comment
													moderation are discussed.</p>

													<p> Journalists have engaged in interviewing practices since the nineteenth century to collect information for news stories. Today, it is considered the dominant approach in news-gathering
														among journalists. We know very little, however, about the theoretical breadth of interviewing
														and the associated competencies construct that journalists should possess to be classified as an
														expert interviewer. Consequently, the first appropriate step toward specification of this particular
														news-gathering practice is qualitative research. In the present study, we explored the breadth of
														journalistic interviewing competencies through 20 semi-structured interviews with journalists and
														journalism educators. The present study revealed 10 possible journalistic interviewing competencies: listening, interaction management, research, empathy, articulation, self-presentation, verification, news judgment, observation, and open-mindedness, based on editor and educator responses.
														The results demonstrate the complexity of interviewing in journalistic settings and suggest a need
														for greater empirical and educational focus on the art of interviewing.</p>
